# Pipelinethesis
R code and data for my senior thesis about the economics of pipeline incidents (ECON 691 and 692, UNC)

All data necessary for the code is in the Data folder. The code will also create a separate Output folder for graphs, etc.

The order in which the files should be run is 01-02-04. 03 is currently a STATA file created by Dr. Klara Peter and me, which is not ready to be shared quite yet. I am working on replacing it in R. The code will still run as is, since the STATA results are included in Data and imported into file 04.
